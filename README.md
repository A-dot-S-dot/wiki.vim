# Introduction

This is a relatively simple wiki plugin for Vim that provides some essential
features for maintaining a personal text based wiki.

  - ISSUE_TEMPLATE
  - CONTRIBUTION

# Acknowledgements

The plugin started out as a fork of [vimwiki](vimwiki/vimwiki) that I made
because I needed a limited subset of the `vimwiki` project.
