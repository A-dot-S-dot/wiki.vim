INTRODUCTION                                                       *wiki-intro*

This is a Vim plugin for writing and maintaining a personal wiki in Markdown
syntax. It is based on vimwiki [0], but written mostly from scratch.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements~
                                                      *wiki-intro-requirements*

This plugin is mainly developed on and for Linux. Some or most of the features
should still work on Windows and OSX, but currently there are no guaranties.

The following is a list of external tools that are used for some of the
features:

- `date`
- `xdg-open`

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Features~
                                                          *wiki-intro-features*

- Syntax highlighting for `.wiki` files (only within the personal wiki)
- Completion of wiki links and link anchors
- Mappings
  - Global mappings for accessing the wiki
  - Local mappings for
    - Navigation (follow links, go back, etc)
    - Renaming pages (will also update links in other pages)
    - Creating a table of contents
    - Toggling links
    - Toggling lists (marking as done/undone or add/remove TODO)
    - Running code snippets (Note: This needs work)
    - Viewing wiki link graphs
- Support for journal entries
  - Navigating the journal back and forth with `<c-j>` and `<c-k>`
  - Support for parsing journal entries in order to make weekly and monthly
  summaries. The parsed result needs manual editing for good results.
- Text objects
  - `il al` Link url
  - `it at` Link text
  - `ic ac` Code blocks
- Folds
- Third-party support
  - unite and denite sources

==============================================================================
SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING                                               *wiki-syntax*

This plugin supports a relatively standard type of simple Markdown syntax.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Common elements~
                                                           *wiki-syntax-common*  

The following listing shows the set of common syntax elements that are
currently supported: >

  # Level 1 headings

  ## Level 2 headings

  Supports up to 6 levels.

  Supports:
  - *bold text*
  - _italic text_
  - `inline code`
  - math: $f(x) = 1$

  Tables like this are supported:
  |-----+-----------|
  | ID  | Value     |
  |-----+-----------|
  | 1   | Entry 1   |
  | 2   | Entry 2   |
  | ... | Entry ... |
  | 12  | Entry 12  |
  |-----+-----------|

  List bullets are either - or *. One can also create check lists like this:

  - [ ] List item 1
  - [.] List item 2
  - [o] List item 3
  - [x] List item 4

  > Blocks of text like this are highlighted as quotes even if
  they don't start with the initial quote symbol.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Links~
                                                            *wiki-syntax-links*  

The following listing shows some examples of links.  Links with descriptions
support concealing to show only the description text. >

  [[Link]]
  [[Link|With description]]

  [Description](Link)

  Inline numbered links like this is also supported [0]. The link is supplied
  below.

  [0]: Link
<
In the above listing, the `Link` is either a wiki link, i.e. the basename of
a file in the wiki, or an URL. URLs will also be highlighted directly. Some
examples of supported URL types: >

  journal:2013-04-05
  http://www.google.com
  doi:10.1002%2Fandp.19053220607
  file:/path/to/file

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Code blocks~
                                                             *wiki-syntax-code*    

Code blocks are blocks like the following: >

  ```sh
  ls ~
  echo "hello world"
  ```

If the code block has a language specifier, then the block will be highlighted
accordingly.

Note: The file is parsed when opened for code blocks, and only the languages
      detected are highlighted. Thus, if one adds a new code block with a new
      language, one may need to reload the file to get the appropriate
      highlighting.

==============================================================================
