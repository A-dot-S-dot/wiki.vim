INTRODUCTION                                                *wiki-introduction*

This plugin is a hard fork of vimwiki where most things are very much
simplified. It has the following features:

- Filetype plugin for wiki entries with syntax highlighting (syntax is
  relatively standard Markdown syntax)
- Convenient set of mappings for accessing and navigating the wiki
- Well implemented link handler system that supports various different kinds
  of links

NOTE: The plugin is designed for personal use, and as such, it is NOT written
      with a lot of options and similar for customization.  I have not adhered
      to conventions for writing plugins and I am breaking a lot of "rules".
      This might change with future development, but I don't think I have the
      time to do it in the near future.
